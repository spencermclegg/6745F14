Project Proposal

"CNF Clause Trimming with Gröbner Bases"

Spencer M. Clegg, Matthew Huff, Drew Janibagian

[The general topic area that you plan to study, and the core computational technologies that you wish
to employ. For example, are you interested in combinational circuit verification, sequential circuit or
RTL verification? Will you learn Gröbner basis concepts and their application or will you use BDDs,
SMT solvers, SAT solvers or a combination of these?]

[If you are interested in developing a core engine, say, the F4 algorithm and applying it to a specific
domain — such as over Boolean rings for bit-level circuit verification — then describe the objective
clearly.]

[If you have already refined/finalized the exact problem you wish to solve, then state the problem as
best as you can. If you only have a general idea of the problem, and plan to refine the exact problem
later with my help, it is okay to say so. But, do you best to narrow down the focus as best as you can.]

[Once the problem is described, what approach will you take to address your project. What topic areas
require further study and which papers will you refer to? Provide a (short/relevant) reference list.]

[What tools do you think you plan to develop, and if you already have some implementation ideas, you
should write about it.]

[Try to project a realistic time-line about tasks/milestones you have decided to accomplish.]

[Finally, there’s got to be a “division of labour” among the team-mates. Of course, each team member will
have to perform the same preliminary study so all of you understand the problem being addressed; but
when you get to implementation, not all of you have to do the same things. It is always good to agree
upon each team member’s responsibilities.]
