Project Proposal

"CNF Clause Trimming with Gröbner Bases"

Spencer M. Clegg, Matthew Huff, Drew Janibagian

This project proposes a CNF SAT transformation algorythm employing a unique partitioning technique followed by efficient monomial ordering, polynomial to CNF conversion, and finally, run through a SAT solver engine. Gr¨obner bases as a means to analyze the problem structure. The excercise will follow similar methods of C. Condrat and P. Kalla, “A Grobner Basis Approach to CNF formulae Preprocessing,".

There are five major milestones for this project. 1) Developing the partiioning algorythm, 2) developing the monomial ordering algorythm, 3) devloping the code to convert the results of (1) and (2) into CNF and run through a SAT solver, 4) final integration and debugging, and 5) authoring results into a final project paper. Each team member will be deeply involed with each potion of the project; however, each member will lead or "own" a portion of the project as such:

Matthew Huff - Partitioning
Spencer Clegg - Monomial Ordering
Drew Janibagian - CNF Conversion and SAT solving

[Once the problem is described, what approach will you take to address your project. What topic areas
require further study and which papers will you refer to? Provide a (short/relevant) reference list.]

[What tools do you think you plan to develop, and if you already have some implementation ideas, you
should write about it.]
